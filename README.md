# Pokémon Legends: Arceus - Angular Clone

In order to *git gud* at both CSS and Angular and also as a way to have something on my resume, I decided to make a clone of PLA's (Pokémon Legends: Arceus) User Interface in Angular 19

## Cloning and Running the project


1. `git clone` the project.
2. `cd angular-pla` to get inside of the project's directory
3. Run `n`

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.dev/tools/cli) page.
